# Roadmap

The aim is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In a nutshell, an MVP
seeks to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about our users in a
short time.

the goal of delivering the MVP. We're working on phases:

## Phase 1

- Ability to deploy the S3 Gateway on a K8s or K3s cluster with.
- [Design mockups][1] for User management & an S3 explorer.

## Phase 2

- Basic S3 explorer UI

- Implement CI/CD
