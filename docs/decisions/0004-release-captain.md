# Context and Problem Statement

We want to share the responsibility of release management. Each week of the
release, one team member will be responsible for all release-related tasks. This
team member will be the release captain.

This document defines and agrees on the responsibilities of said release
captain.

## Considered Options

### Responsibilities of a Release Captain

The release captain is responsible for the content of a release. That means
taking appropriate measures to include all necessary fixes and features as well
as delivering sane and functional container images. The release captain is also
responsible for describing the changes of the new release in the release notes.

## Decision Outcome

The proposed steps are approved and this document can be used as reference.
